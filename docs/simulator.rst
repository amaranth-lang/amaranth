.. py:module:: amaranth.sim

The :mod:`amaranth.sim` module, also known as the simulator, makes it possible to evaluate a design's functionality in a virtual environment before it is implemented in hardware.


Simulating circuits
-------------------

.. testsetup::

    from amaranth import *

The following examples simulate one of the two designs below: synchronous counter running in the ``sync`` clock domain, and combinational adder. They assume familiarity with the :doc:`language guide <guide>`.

.. testcode::

    from amaranth.lib import wiring
    from amaranth.lib.wiring import In, Out

    class Counter(wiring.Component):
        en: In(1, init=1)
        count: Out(4)

        def elaborate(self, platform):
            m = Module()
            with m.If(self.en):
                m.d.sync += self.count.eq(self.count + 1)
            return m

    class Adder(wiring.Component):
        a: In(16)
        b: In(16)
        o: Out(17)

        def elaborate(self, platform):
            m = Module()
            m.d.comb += self.o.eq(self.a + self.b)
            return m


Running a simulation
++++++++++++++++++++

Simulating a design always requires the three basic steps: constructing the :abbr:`DUT (Design Under Test)`, constructing a :class:`Simulator` for it, and running the simulation with the :meth:`Simulator.run` or :meth:`Simulator.run_until` method:

.. testcode::

    from amaranth.sim import Simulator

    dut = Counter()
    sim = Simulator(dut)
    sim.run()

However, the code above neither stimulates the DUT's inputs nor measures the DUT's outputs; the :meth:`Simulator.run` method also immediately returns if no stimulus is added to the simulation. To make it useful, several changes are necessary:

* The :meth:`Simulator.add_clock` method adds a *stimulus*: a process external to the DUT that manipulates its inputs (in this case, toggles the clock of the ``sync`` domain).
* The :meth:`Simulator.run_until` method runs the simulation until a specific deadline is reached.
* The :meth:`Simulator.write_vcd` method captures the DUT's inputs, state, and outputs, and writes it to a :abbr:`VCD (Value Change Dump)` file.

.. _Surfer: https://surfer-project.org/
.. _GTKWave: https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/

The following code simulates a design and capture the values of all the signals used in the design for each moment of simulation time:

.. testcode::

    dut = Counter()
    sim = Simulator(dut)
    sim.add_clock(1e-6) # 1 Âµs period, or 1 MHz
    with sim.write_vcd("example1.vcd"):
        sim.run_until(1e-6 * 15) # 15 periods of the clock

The captured data is saved to a :abbr:`VCD` file :file:`example1.vcd`, which can be displayed with a *waveform viewer* such as Surfer_ or GTKWave_:

.. wavedrom:: simulator/example1

    {
        "head": {"tock": 0},
        "signal": [
            {"name": "clk",   "wave": "lp.............."},
            {"name": "rst",   "wave": "l..............."},
            {"name": "en",    "wave": "h..............."},
            {"name": "count", "wave": "================",
             "data": ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15"]}
        ]
    }

The :meth:`Simulator.reset` method reverts the simulation to its initial state. It can be used to speed up tests by capturing the waveforms only when the simulation is known to encounter an error:

.. testcode::

    try:
        sim.run()
    except:
        sim.reset()
        with sim.write_vcd("example1_error.vcd"):
            sim.run()


Testing synchronous circuits
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To verify that the DUT works as intended during a simulation, known values are provided as the inputs, and the outputs are compared with the expected results.

This is done by adding a different type of stimulus to the simulator, a *testbench*: an :py:`async` Python function that runs concurrently with the DUT and can manipulate the signals used in the simulation. A testbench is added using the :meth:`Simulator.add_testbench` method, and receives a :class:`SimulatorContext` object through which it can interact with the simulator: inspect the value of signals using the :meth:`ctx.get() <SimulatorContext.get>` method, change the value of signals using the :meth:`ctx.set() <SimulatorContext.set>` method, or wait for an active edge of a :ref:`clock domain <lang-clockdomains>` using the :meth:`ctx.tick() <SimulatorContext.tick>` method.

The following example simulates a counter and verifies that it can be stopped using its :py:`en` input:

.. testcode::

    dut = Counter()

    async def testbench_example2(ctx):
        await ctx.tick().repeat(5)     # wait until after the 5th edge of the `sync` domain clock
        assert ctx.get(dut.count) == 5 # verify that the counter has the expected value
        ctx.set(dut.en, False)         # deassert `dut.en`, disabling the counter
        await ctx.tick().repeat(5)     # wait until after the 10th edge of clock
        assert ctx.get(dut.count) == 5 # verify that the counter has not been incrementing
        ctx.set(dut.en, True)          # assert `dut.en`, enabling the counter again

    sim = Simulator(dut)
    sim.add_clock(1e-6)
    sim.add_testbench(testbench_example2) # add the testbench; run_until() calls the function
    with sim.write_vcd("example2.vcd"):
        sim.run_until(1e-6 * 15)

Since this circuit is synchronous, and the :meth:`ctx.tick() <SimulatorContext.tick>` method waits until after the circuit has reacted to the clock edge, the change to the :py:`en` input affects the behavior of the circuit on the next clock cycle after the change:

.. wavedrom:: simulator/example2

    {
        "head": {"tock": 0},
        "signal": [
            {"name": "clk",   "wave": "lp.............."},
            {"name": "rst",   "wave": "l..............."},
            {"name": "en",    "wave": "h....0....1....."},
            {"name": "count", "wave": "======.....=====",
             "data": ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"]}
        ]
    }


Testing combinational circuits
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A testbench that tests a combinational circuit advances simulation time using the :meth:`ctx.delay() <SimulatorContext.delay>` method instead of the :meth:`ctx.tick() <SimulatorContext.tick>` method, since the simulation does not contain a clock in this case. The :meth:`Simulator.run` method stops the simulation and returns once all testbenches finish executing.

The following example simulates an adder:

.. testcode::

    dut = Adder()

    async def testbench_example3(ctx):
        await ctx.delay(1e-6)
        ctx.set(dut.a, 2)
        ctx.set(dut.b, 2)
        assert ctx.get(dut.o) == 4

        await ctx.delay(1e-6)
        ctx.set(dut.a, 1717)
        ctx.set(dut.b, 420)
        assert ctx.get(dut.o) == 2137

        await ctx.delay(2e-6)

    sim = Simulator(dut)
    sim.add_testbench(testbench_example3)
    with sim.write_vcd("example3.vcd"):
        sim.run()

Since this circuit is entirely combinational, and the Amaranth simulator uses a *zero-delay model* of combinational circuits, the outputs change in the same instant as the inputs do:

.. wavedrom:: simulator/example3

    {
        "signal": [
            {"name": "a", "wave": "===.", "data": [0, 2, 1717]},
            {"name": "b", "wave": "===.", "data": [0, 2, 420]},
            {"name": "o", "wave": "===.", "data": [0, 4, 2137]}
        ]
    }


Replacing circuits with code
----------------------------

.. note::

    This section describes an advanced technique that is not commonly used. If you are first learning how to use the simulator, you can skip it.

During simulation, it is possible to replace an Amaranth circuit with the equivalent Python code. This can be used to improve simulation performance, or to avoid reimplementing complex Python algorithms in Amaranth if they do not need to be synthesized.

This is done by adding a *process* to the simulator: an :py:`async` Python function that runs as an integral part of the simulation, simultaneously with the DUT. A process is added using the :meth:`Simulator.add_process` method, and receives a :class:`SimulatorContext` object through which it can interact with the simulator. A process is conceptually similar to a testbench but differs from it in two important ways:

* Testbenches run in a well-defined order (from first to last in the order they were added, yielding control only at :py:`await` points) and cannot observe inconsistent intermediate states of a design, but processes run in an undefined order while the design is converging after a change to its inputs.
* In a process, it is not possible to inspect the value of a signal using the :meth:`ctx.get() <SimulatorContext.get>` method, which guarantees that inconsistent intermediate states of a design cannot be observed by a process either.

A process communicates with the rest of the design in the same way an elaboratable would: through :class:`Signal`\ s.


Replacing synchronous circuits
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Processes cannot inspect values of signals using the :meth:`ctx.get() <SimulatorContext.get>` method. Instead, values of signals in a synchronous process are sampled at each active edge of the clock domain (or, for domains with asynchronous reset, at the assertion of the reset signal) using the :meth:`ctx.tick() <SimulatorContext.tick>` method.

The following code replaces the :py:`Counter` elaboratable with the equivalent Python code in a process, and uses a testbench to verify its correct operation:

.. testcode::

    m = Module()
    m.domains.sync = cd_sync = ClockDomain()
    en = Signal(init=1)
    count = Signal(4)

    async def process_example4(ctx):
        count_value = 0 # initialize counter to 0
        async for clk_edge, rst_value, en_value in ctx.tick().sample(en):
            if rst_value: # can be asserted with or without clk_edge
                count_value = 0 # re-initialize counter
            elif clk_edge and en_value:
                count_value += 1 # advance the counter
                ctx.set(count, count_value) # publish its value to the simulation

    async def testbench_example4(ctx):
        await ctx.tick().repeat(5)
        assert ctx.get(count) == 5
        ctx.set(en, False)
        await ctx.tick().repeat(5)
        assert ctx.get(count) == 5
        ctx.set(en, True)

    sim = Simulator(m)
    sim.add_clock(1e-6)
    sim.add_process(process_example4)
    sim.add_testbench(testbench_example4)
    with sim.write_vcd("example4.vcd", traces=(cd_sync.clk, cd_sync.rst, en, count)):
        sim.run()

Unless it is instructed otherwise, the :meth:`Simulator.write_vcd` method only captures values of signals that appear in the circuit provided to the simulator when it is created. The :py:`en` and :py:`count` signals do not, and are added explicitly using the :py:`traces` argument so that they will appear in the VCD file.


Replacing combinational circuits
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Values of signals in a combinational process are sampled anytime they change using the :meth:`ctx.changed() <SimulatorContext.changed>` method.

The following code replaces the :py:`Adder` elaboratable with the equivalent Python code in a process, and uses a testbench to verify its correct operation:

.. testcode::

    m = Module()
    a = Signal(16)
    b = Signal(16)
    o = Signal(17)

    async def process_example5(ctx):
        async for a_value, b_value in ctx.changed(a, b):
            ctx.set(o, a_value + b_value)

    async def testbench_example5(ctx):
        await ctx.delay(1e-6)
        ctx.set(a, 2)
        ctx.set(b, 2)
        assert ctx.get(o) == 4

        await ctx.delay(1e-6)
        ctx.set(a, 1717)
        ctx.set(b, 420)
        assert ctx.get(o) == 2137

        await ctx.delay(2e-6)

    sim = Simulator(m)
    sim.add_process(process_example5)
    sim.add_testbench(testbench_example5)
    with sim.write_vcd("example5.vcd", traces=[a, b, o]):
        sim.run()
