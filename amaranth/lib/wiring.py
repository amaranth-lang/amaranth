        This implementation creates an interface object from this signature that serves purely
        as a container for the attributes corresponding to the signature members, and implements
        no behavior. Such an implementation is sufficient for signatures created ad-hoc using
        the :py:`Signature({ ... })` constructor as well as simple signature subclasses.

        When defining a :class:`Signature` subclass that needs to customize the behavior of
        the created interface objects, override this method with a similar implementation
        that references the class of your custom interface object:

        .. testcode::

            class CustomSignature(wiring.Signature):
                def create(self, *, path=None, src_loc_at=0):

        The :py:`path` and :py:`src_loc_at` arguments are necessary to ensure the generated signals
        have informative names and accurate source location information.

        The custom :meth:`create` method may take positional or keyword arguments in addition to
        the two listed above. Such arguments must have a default value, because
        the :meth:`SignatureMembers.create` method will call the :meth:`Signature.create` member
        without these additional arguments when this signature is a member of another signature.

    Although an instance of :class:`FlippedSignature` could be created directly, it will be usually
    created by a call to :meth:`Signature.flip`.

    This proxy is a wrapper around :class:`Signature` that contains the same description as
    the inner mapping, but flips the members' data flow when they are accessed. It is useful
    because :class:`Signature` objects are mutable and may include custom behavior, and if one was
    copied (rather than wrapped) by :meth:`Signature.flip`, the wrong object would be mutated, and
    custom behavior would be unavailable.

    For example:

    .. testcode::

        sig = wiring.Signature({"foo": Out(1)})

        flipped_sig = sig.flip()
        assert flipped_sig.members["foo"].flow == In

        assert sig.attr == flipped_sig.attr == 2

    the members' data flow), as the :class:`Signature` class; see the documentation for that class
    for details.

    This function creates connections between ports of several interface objects. (Any number of

    The connections can be made only if all of the objects satisfy a number of requirements:

    * Every interface object must have the same set of port members, and they must have the same
      :meth:`dimensions <Member.dimensions>`.
    * For each path, the port members of every interface object must have the same width and initial
      value (for port members corresponding to signals) or constant value (for port members
      corresponding to constants). Signedness may differ.
    * For each path, at most one interface object must have the corresponding port member be
      an output.
    * For a given path, if any of the interface objects has an input port member corresponding
      to a constant value, then the rest of the interface objects must have output port members
      corresponding to the same constant value.
    * When connecting multiple interface objects, at least one connection must be made.

    For example, if :py:`obj1` is being connected to :py:`obj2` and :py:`obj3`, and :py:`obj1.a.b`
    is an output, then :py:`obj2.a.b` and :py:`obj2.a.b` must exist and be inputs. If :py:`obj2.c`
    is an input and its value is :py:`Const(1)`, then :py:`obj1.c` and :py:`obj3.c` must be outputs
    whose value is also :py:`Const(1)`. If no ports besides :py:`obj1.a.b` and :py:`obj1.c` exist,
    then no ports except for those two must exist on :py:`obj2` and :py:`obj3` either.

    Where :py:`out1` is an output and :py:`in1`, :py:`in2`, ... are the inputs that have the same

    The positions (within :py:`args`) or names (within :py:`kwargs`) of the arguments do not affect
    the connections that are made. There is no difference in behavior between :py:`connect(m, a, b)`
    and :py:`connect(m, b, a)` or :py:`connect(m, arbiter=a, decoder=b)`. The names of the keyword
    arguments serve only a documentation purpose: they clarify the diagnostic messages when

class Component(Elaboratable):
    """Base class for elaboratable interface objects.

    A component is an :class:`Elaboratable` whose interaction with other parts of the design is
    defined by its signature. Most if not all elaboratables in idiomatic Amaranth code should be
    components, as the signature clarifies the direction of data flow at their boundary. See
    the :ref:`introduction to interfaces <wiring-intro1>` section for a practical guide to defining
    and using components.

    There are two ways to define a component. If all instances of a component have the same
    signature, it can be defined using :term:`variable annotations <python:variable annotation>`:

    .. testcode::

        class FixedComponent(wiring.Component):
            en: In(1)
            data: Out(8)

    The variable annotations are collected by the constructor :meth:`Component.__init__`. Only
    public (not starting with ``_``) annotations with :class:`In <Member>` or :class:`Out <Member>`
    objects are considered; all other annotations are ignored under the assumption that they are
    interpreted by some other tool.

    It is possible to use inheritance to extend a component: the component's signature is composed
    from the variable annotations in the class that is being constructed as well as all of its
    base classes. It is an error to have more than one variable annotation for the same attribute.

    If different instances of a component may need to have different signatures, variable
    annotations cannot be used. In this case, the constructor should be overridden, and
    the computed signature members should be provided to the superclass constructor:

    .. testcode::

        class ParametricComponent(wiring.Component):
            def __init__(self, data_width):
                super().__init__({
                    "en": In(1),
                    "data": Out(data_width)
                })

    It is also possible to pass a :class:`Signature` instance to the superclass constructor.

    Aside from initializing the :attr:`signature` attribute, the :meth:`Component.__init__`
    constructor creates attributes corresponding to all of the members defined in the signature.
    If an attribute with the same name as that of a member already exists, an error is raied.

    Raises
    ------
    :exc:`TypeError`
        If the :py:`signature` object is neither a :class:`Signature` nor a :class:`dict`.
        If neither variable annotations nor the :py:`signature` argument are present, or if
        both are present.
    :exc:`NameError`
        If a name conflict is detected between two variable annotations, or between a member
        and an existing attribute.
