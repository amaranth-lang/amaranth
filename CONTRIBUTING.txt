USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS / "GENERATIVE AI" TOOLS

Contributions created using large language models or "generative AI" tools are
not accepted.

The burden of ensuring the appropriateness of a contribution lies on its
author, with code review being a tool to assist this process, and even partial
shift of this responsibility to reviewers that occurs when these tools are
used is both unethical and unsustainable.
